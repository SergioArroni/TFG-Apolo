== Architecture Constraints

=== Technical constraints

|===
|Constraint|Explanation
|React|We will use the React Framework for the UI (User Interface). This ir a requirement
|SOLID|With SOLID, we'll be able to let people be propietary of their own intformation using PODs. This way, they can allow or reject the application to access the data or not. This is a requirement
|Docker|The application will be running in a Docker Host
|GitHub|We will use GitHub to deploy the project and all the files related with it. This is a requirement
|TypeScrypt|TypeScript is the techonology used for the backend. Based on JavaScript is quite similar. This is a requirement
|Node.js|Based on JavaScript, is a backend technology wich allows us to execute our code

=== Organizational and political constraints

|===
|Constraint|Explanation
|Team and meetings|This is a course application. Development team consist in 5 (five) people with a very limited experience in techonolgies used in the project. Is our first time working together, so some organizational decisions could be not as agile or accurate as they could. Also we don't have the same class schedule so find a room for a meeting could be difficult sometimes
|Time|The project has a very tight time to be finished. This means that our application will not be as developed as it could be
|Deadlines|This application is part of course calification criteria. This means we have several deadlines and important releases in a target date. This means we can have trouble finishing the parts we need to release in some of that targets.

=== Conventions

|===
|Constraint|Explanation
|Aesthetic and ease of use|The UI (User Interface) has to be aesthetic and easy to use. Both of them are very important criteria in our application, so all of our decisions need to have this in mind
|Documentation|We will use Arc42 template to develop documentation
|Solid|The application must follow Solid conventions
|TypeScript|We will use TypeScript/JavaScript naming conventions
|Redux|We will use Redux style guide (based on REACT) conventions
|MVC|We will follow MVC conventions in naming and layer separation
|W3C AAA|Our application will follow AAA conventions. This allow us to make the aplication more usable to everybody
