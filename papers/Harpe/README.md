### Special issue information

Critical infrastructure plays a fundamental role in our daily life. Most of today’s critical infrastructure systems connect to the Internet, where information technology (IT) and operational technology (OT) are tightly integrated. The convergence of IT and OT provides the convenience of remote controls and operations and exponentially expands the system’s attacking surface. In recent years, AI-driven techniques have become popular to detect emerging cyberattacks because of their superior efficiency compared to manual analysis. A generic approach to AI-driven practice includes scenario analysis, cyber attack identification, problem formulation, AI model customization, data acquisition, model training, and performance evaluation. To perform these steps, one needs domain-specific knowledge of cyber issues and insights into AI principles and skills. Issues of combining AI and critical infrastructure’s attack detection remain understudied, particularly in designing and implementing effective and efficient applications and solutions using machine learning, data mining, and big data technologies.

The aim of the proposed Special Issue is to promote research and reflect the most recent advances of infrastructure cybersecurity using AI and machine learning, data mining and big data technologies, with the emphasis on the following aspects, but certainly not limited to:

- AI-driven countermeasures to cyber-attacks
- AI and human factors for infrastructure security
- AI-assisted cryptography for infrastructure security
- AI-driven cybersecurity for vehicles and vehicular networks
- AI-driven cybersecurity for industrial control systems
- AI-driven cybersecurity for healthcare monitoring systems
- AI-driven cybersecurity for edge computing infrastructure
- AI-driven cybersecurity for cloud-based critical applications
- AI-driven cybersecurity for multimedia on critical infrastructure
- AI-driven cybersecurity for narrowband critical infrastructure
- AI-driven cybersecurity for critical mobile networks
- AI-driven cybersecurity for SDN-based critical infrastructure
- AI-driven botnet detection for critical infrastructure
- AI-driven malware analytics for critical infrastructure
- AI-driven vulnerability analytics for critical infrastructure
