== Deployment View

=== Infrastructure Level 1

* Motivation:
 This diagram helps us to point out the different components that we will have to use and their dependencies. It helps us to visualise the deployment path for the system to work. 

* Quality and/or Performance Features:
 To improve the quality of our system we have used the best technologies at our disposal, trying to minimise waiting times for user requests. It helps us to use MongoDB, as it is a very efficient DB.

=== Infrastructure Level 2

* Motivation:
 This second diagram details the launching of the layers that we have to do ourselves, see WebApp and RestApi. 

* Quality and/or Performance Features:
 As we can see in the following image, we are going to use AWS to deploy the application, serving as a remote server. We will also use Docker to launch each part of the system.
